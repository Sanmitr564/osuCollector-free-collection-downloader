# osuCollector-free-collection-downloader

A tool that will automatically download all the beatmapsets in a collection from [osu!Collector](https://osucollector.com/)  
Mainly did it just to see if I could  
If you like the service that [osu!Collector](https://osucollector.com/) provides you should still pay for it  
If you are one of the owners of [osu!Collector](https://osucollector.com/) and would like me to remove this/make this private then dm sanmitr#4831 on Discord  
If you wish to use this you will need to edit lines 14, 15, and 16  
# Caveats:  
In a moral grey zone  
Not really user friendly bcuz all I cared about was getting the application to work  
You need to provide your own Osu! api key and client id  
Its much slower than downloading directly from [osu!Collector](https://osucollector.com/) (I can't be bothered to learn threading)  
Might need a virtual environment? Idk what those are for but I needed one to use the libraries I imported while writing it (as of the day I'm writing this I mainly code in Java)  
You need to have google chrome installed on your device (if the version of chrome you are running is not 100 you may need to replace chromedriver.exe with a different version)
